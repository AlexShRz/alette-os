# Infinite scroll
**Infinite scroll** is a version of [pagination](./pagination.md), where new response chunks
are loaded automatically the moment a "pagination trigger" is activated.

## Pagination trigger
**A pagination trigger** in infinite scrolling is a combination of requirements
that when completed sends a request requiring more response chunks to the server.

**A pagination trigger can be:**
1. **A scroll threshold** – a request for more data is sent when the page end is reached. 
2. **A manual trigger** – a “Load more” button, clicked 
to send a request for more data.

## Infinite scroll parameters
