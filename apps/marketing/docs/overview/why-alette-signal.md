⚠️ **Outdated Content:** This page contains incorrect information and can be confusing.  
It will be rewritten soon to focus on front-end monorepos.

👋 **Note from the author:**
This page confuses a lot of people at the moment - from the assumption that `.with()` must 
be used inside UI components to the lack of context - where Alette Signal should be used and why, 
how to use requests inside UI, comparisons with other libraries, etc. This page will be rewritten, 
but later - at the moment I'm focusing on technical things, not marketing/documentation.

I recommend skipping this page completely and starting from [configuring requests](../getting-started/configuring-requests.md)
for now.
