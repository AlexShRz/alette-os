## What do I get as a Partner?
**As an Alette Signal Partner, you get 5 benefits:**
1. **Your logo on Alette Signal home page and in the sidebar + a backlink to your product**.  
2. **Private discord support channel for your developers**. 
A private discord channel allowing us to help your developers faster - both parties get full context of the problem
needed to be solved without breaking NDA. (NDA signing can be discussed).  
3. **Examples of integrating with your product in the documentation (if needed)**. 
Integration examples speed up the adoption of your product, while 
giving you exposure to developers using Alette Signal 
(the integration documentation text can be written using your guidelines if needed).
4. **Advertisements using the banner above the documentation (if needed)**. 
The text banner above the documentation can display your ads - you can promote your products,
conferences, etc. to developers.
5. **Alette Signal roadmap influence.** When a new feature is being researched,
we might ask your developers what your company or products needs, 
and what they are struggling with, to make sure our feature design fits your company needs.
